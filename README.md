## Summary and Purpose

libCEED provides fast algebra for element-based discretizations, designed for performance portability, run-time flexibility, and clean embedding in higher level libraries and applications.
It offers a C99 interface as well as bindings for Fortran, Python, Julia, and Rust.
While our focus is on high-order finite elements, the approach is mostly algebraic and thus applicable to other discretizations in factored form, as explained in the [user manual](https://libceed.org/en/latest/) and API implementation portion of the [documentation](https://libceed.org/en/latest/api/).

One of the challenges with high-order methods is that a global sparse matrix is no longer a good representation of a high-order linear operator, both with respect to the FLOPs needed for its evaluation, as well as the memory transfer needed for a matvec.
Thus, high-order methods require a new "format" that still represents a linear (or more generally non-linear) operator, but not through a sparse matrix.

The goal of libCEED is to propose such a format, as well as supporting implementations and data structures, that enable efficient operator evaluation on a variety of computational device types (CPUs, GPUs, etc.).
This new operator description is based on algebraically [factored form](https://libceed.org/en/latest/libCEEDapi/#finite-element-operator-decomposition), which is easy to incorporate in a wide variety of applications, without significant refactoring of their own discretization infrastructure.

The repository is part of the [CEED software suite](http://ceed.exascaleproject.org/software/), a collection of software benchmarks, miniapps, libraries and APIs for efficient exascale discretizations based on high-order finite element and spectral element methods.
See <http://github.com/ceed> for more information and source code availability.

The CEED research is supported by the [Exascale Computing Project](https://exascaleproject.org/exascale-computing-project) (17-SC-20-SC), a collaborative effort of two U.S. Department of Energy organizations (Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration) responsible for the planning and preparation of a [capable exascale ecosystem](https://exascaleproject.org/what-is-exascale), including software, applications, hardware, advanced system engineering and early testbed platforms, in support of the nationâ€™s exascale computing imperative.

For more details on the CEED API see the [user manual](https://libceed.org/en/latest/).

## Building

The CEED library, `libceed`, is a C99 library with no required dependencies, and with Fortran, Python, Julia, and Rust interfaces.
It can be built using:

```console
$ make
```

or, with optimization flags:

```console
$ make OPT='-O3 -march=skylake-avx512 -ffp-contract=fast'
```

These optimization flags are used by all languages (C, C++, Fortran) and this makefile variable can also be set for testing and examples (below).

The library attempts to automatically detect support for the AVX instruction set using gcc-style compiler options for the host.
Support may need to be manually specified via:

```console
$ make AVX=1
```

or:

```console
$ make AVX=0
```

if your compiler does not support gcc-style options, if you are cross compiling, etc.

To enable CUDA support, add `CUDA_DIR=/opt/cuda` or an appropriate directory to your `make` invocation.
To enable HIP support, add `ROCM_DIR=/opt/rocm` or an appropriate directory.
To enable SYCL support, add `SYCL_DIR=/opt/sycl` or an appropriate directory.
Note that SYCL backends require building with oneAPI compilers as well:

```console
$ . /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
$ make SYCL_DIR=/opt/intel/oneapi/compiler/latest/linux SYCLCXX=icpx CC=icx CXX=icpx
```

The library can be configured for host applications which use OpenMP paralellism via:

```console
$ make OPENMP=1
```

which will allow operators created and applied from different threads inside an `omp parallel` region.

To store these or other arguments as defaults for future invocations of `make`, use:

```console
$ make configure CUDA_DIR=/usr/local/cuda ROCM_DIR=/opt/rocm OPT='-O3 -march=znver2'
```

which stores these variables in `config.mk`.

### WebAssembly

libCEED can be built for WASM using [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org). For example, one can build the library and run a standalone WASM executable using

``` console
$ emmake make build/ex2-surface.wasm
$ wasmer build/ex2-surface.wasm -- -s 200000
```

## Additional Language Interfaces

The Fortran interface is built alongside the library automatically.

Python users can install using:

```console
$ pip install libceed
```

or in a clone of the repository via `pip install .`.

Julia users can install using:

```console
$ julia
julia> ]
pkg> add LibCEED
```

See the [LibCEED.jl documentation](http://ceed.exascaleproject.org/libCEED-julia-docs/dev/) for more information.

Rust users can include libCEED via `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
libceed = "0.12.0"
```

See the [Cargo documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#specifying-dependencies-from-git-repositories) for details.

## Testing

The test suite produces [TAP](https://testanything.org) output and is run by:

```console
$ make test
```

or, using the `prove` tool distributed with Perl (recommended):

```console
$ make prove
```

## Backends

There are multiple supported backends, which can be selected at runtime in the examples:

The `/cpu/self/*/serial` backends process one element at a time and are intended for meshes with a smaller number of high order elements.
The `/cpu/self/*/blocked` backends process blocked batches of eight interlaced elements and are intended for meshes with higher numbers of elements.

The `/cpu/self/ref/*` backends are written in pure C and provide basic functionality.

The `/cpu/self/opt/*` backends are written in pure C and use partial e-vectors to improve performance.

The `/cpu/self/avx/*` backends rely upon AVX instructions to provide vectorized CPU performance.

The `/cpu/self/memcheck/*` backends rely upon the [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) Memcheck tool to help verify that user QFunctions have no undefined values.
To use, run your code with Valgrind and the Memcheck backends, e.g. `valgrind ./build/ex1 -ceed /cpu/self/ref/memcheck`.
A 'development' or 'debugging' version of Valgrind with headers is required to use this backend.
This backend can be run in serial or blocked mode and defaults to running in the serial mode if `/cpu/self/memcheck` is selected at runtime.

The `/cpu/self/xsmm/*` backends rely upon the [LIBXSMM](https://github.com/libxsmm/libxsmm) package to provide vectorized CPU performance.
If linking MKL and LIBXSMM is desired but the Makefile is not detecting `MKLROOT`, linking libCEED against MKL can be forced by setting the environment variable `MKL=1`.

The `/gpu/cuda/*` backends provide GPU performance strictly using CUDA.

The `/gpu/hip/*` backends provide GPU performance strictly using HIP.
They are based on the `/gpu/cuda/*` backends.
ROCm version 4.2 or newer is required.

The `/gpu/sycl/*` backends provide GPU performance strictly using SYCL.
They are based on the `/gpu/cuda/*` and `/gpu/hip/*` backends.

The `/gpu/*/magma/*` backends rely upon the [MAGMA](https://bitbucket.org/icl/magma) package.
To enable the MAGMA backends, the environment variable `MAGMA_DIR` must point to the top-level MAGMA directory, with the MAGMA library located in `$(MAGMA_DIR)/lib/`.
By default, `MAGMA_DIR` is set to `../magma`; to build the MAGMA backends with a MAGMA installation located elsewhere, create a link to `magma/` in libCEED's parent directory, or set `MAGMA_DIR` to the proper location.
MAGMA version 2.5.0 or newer is required.
Currently, each MAGMA library installation is only built for either CUDA or HIP.
The corresponding set of libCEED backends (`/gpu/cuda/magma/*` or `/gpu/hip/magma/*`) will automatically be built for the version of the MAGMA library found in `MAGMA_DIR`.

Users can specify a device for all CUDA, HIP, and MAGMA backends through adding `:device_id=#` after the resource name.
For example:

> - `/gpu/cuda/gen:device_id=1`

The `/*/occa` backends rely upon the [OCCA](http://github.com/libocca/occa) package to provide cross platform performance.
To enable the OCCA backend, the environment variable `OCCA_DIR` must point to the top-level OCCA directory, with the OCCA library located in the `${OCCA_DIR}/lib` (By default, `OCCA_DIR` is set to `../occa`).
OCCA version 1.4.0 or newer is required.

Users can pass specific OCCA device properties after setting the CEED resource.
For example:

> - `"/*/occa:mode='CUDA',device_id=0"`

Bit-for-bit reproducibility is important in some applications.
However, some libCEED backends use non-deterministic operations, such as `atomicAdd` for increased performance.
The backends which are capable of generating reproducible results, with the proper compilation options, are highlighted in the list above.

## Examples

libCEED comes with several examples of its usage, ranging from standalone C codes in the `/examples/ceed` directory to examples based on external packages, such as MFEM, PETSc, and Nek5000.
Nek5000 v18.0 or greater is required.

To build the examples, set the `MFEM_DIR`, `PETSC_DIR`, and `NEK5K_DIR` variables and run:

```console
$ cd examples/
```

```

For the last example shown, sample meshes to be used in place of `[.exo file]` can be found at <https://github.com/jeremylt/ceedSampleMeshes>

The above code assumes a GPU-capable machine with the CUDA backends enabled.
Depending on the available backends, other CEED resource specifiers can be provided with the `-ceed` option.
Other command line arguments can be found in [examples/petsc](https://github.com/CEED/libCEED/blob/main/examples/petsc/README.md).

% benchmarks-marker

## Benchmarks

A sequence of benchmarks for all enabled backends can be run using:

```console
$ make benchmarks
```

The results from the benchmarks are stored inside the `benchmarks/` directory and they can be viewed using the commands (requires python with matplotlib):

```console
$ cd benchmarks
$ python postprocess-plot.py petsc-bps-bp1-*-output.txt
$ python postprocess-plot.py petsc-bps-bp3-*-output.txt
```

Using the `benchmarks` target runs a comprehensive set of benchmarks which may take some time to run.
Subsets of the benchmarks can be run using the scripts in the `benchmarks` folder.

For more details about the benchmarks, see the `benchmarks/README.md` file.

## Install

To install libCEED, run:

```console
$ make install prefix=/path/to/install/dir
```

or (e.g., if creating packages):

```console
$ make install prefix=/usr DESTDIR=/packaging/path
```

To build and install in separate steps, run:

```console
$ make for_install=1 prefix=/path/to/install/dir
$ make install prefix=/path/to/install/dir
```

The usual variables like `CC` and `CFLAGS` are used, and optimization flags for all languages can be set using the likes of `OPT='-O3 -march=native'`.
Use `STATIC=1` to build static libraries (`libceed.a`).

To install libCEED for Python, run:

```console
$ pip install libceed
```

with the desired setuptools options, such as `--user`.

### pkg-config

In addition to library and header, libCEED provides a [pkg-config](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pkg-config) file that can be used to easily compile and link.
[For example](https://people.freedesktop.org/~dbn/pkg-config-guide.html#faq), if `$prefix` is a standard location or you set the environment variable `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`:

```console
$ cc `pkg-config --cflags --libs ceed` -o myapp myapp.c
```

will build `myapp` with libCEED.
This can be used with the source or installed directories.
Most build systems have support for pkg-config.
