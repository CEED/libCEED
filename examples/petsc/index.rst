PETSc demos and BPs
========================================

.. _example-petsc-area:

Area
----------------------------------------

This example is located in the subdirectory :file:`examples/petsc`. It
demonstrates a simple usage of libCEED with PETSc to calculate
the surface area of a closed surface. The code uses higher level
communication protocols for mesh handling in PETSc's DMPlex. This example has the
same mathematical formulation as :ref:`Ex1-Volume`, with the exception that the
physical coordinates for this problem are :math:`\bm{x}=(x,y,z)\in \mathbb{R}^3`,
while the coordinates of the reference element are
:math:`\bm{X}=(X,Y) \equiv (X_0,X_1) \in \textrm{I} =[-1,1]^2`.


.. _example-petsc-area-cube:

Cube
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is one of the test cases of the computation of the :ref:`example-petsc-area` of a
2D manifold embedded in 3D. This problem can be run with::

   ./area -problem cube

This example uses the following coordinate transformations for the computation of the
geometric factors: from the physical coordinates on the cube, denoted by
:math:`\bar{\bm{x}}=(\bar{x},\bar{y},\bar{z})`,
and physical coordinates on the discrete surface, denoted by
:math:`\bm{{x}}=(x,y)`, to :math:`\bm{X}=(X,Y) \in \textrm{I}` on the
reference element, via the chain rule

.. math::
   \frac{\partial \bm{x}}{\partial \bm{X}}_{(2\times2)} = \frac{\partial {\bm{x}}}{\partial \bar{\bm{x}}}_{(2\times3)} \frac{\partial \bar{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{X}}_{(3\times2)},
   :label: eq-coordinate-transforms-cube

with Jacobian determinant given by

.. math::
   \left| J \right| = \left\|col_1\left(\frac{\partial \bar{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{X}}\right)\right\| \left\|col_2 \left(\frac{\partial \bar{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{X}}\right) \right\|
   :label: eq-jacobian-cube

We note that in equation :math:numref:`eq-coordinate-transforms-cube`, the right-most
Jacobian matrix :math:`{\partial\bar{\bm{x}}}/{\partial \bm{X}}_{(3\times2)}` is
provided by the library, while
:math:`{\partial{\bm{x}}}/{\partial \bar{ \bm{x}}}_{(2\times3)}` is
provided by the user as

.. math::
   \left[ col_1\left(\frac{\partial\bar{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{X}}\right) / \left\| col_1\left(\frac{\partial\bar{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{X}}\right)\right\| , col_2\left(\frac{\partial\bar{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{X}}\right) / \left\| col_2\left(\frac{\partial\bar{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{X}}\right)\right\| \right]^T_{(2\times 3)}.


.. _example-petsc-area-sphere:

Sphere
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This problem computes the surface :ref:`example-petsc-area` of a tensor-product
discrete sphere, obtained by projecting a cube inscribed in a sphere onto the surface
of the sphere. This discrete surface is sometimes referred to as a cubed-sphere
(an example of such as a surface is given in figure :numref:`fig-cubed-sphere`).
This problem can be run with::

   ./area -problem sphere

.. _fig-cubed-sphere:

.. figure:: ../../../../img/CubedSphere.svg

   Example of a cubed-sphere, i.e., a tensor-product discrete sphere, obtained by
   projecting a cube inscribed in a sphere onto the surface of the sphere.

This example uses the following coordinate transformations for the computation of the
geometric factors: from the physical coordinates on the sphere, denoted by
:math:`\overset{\circ}{\bm{x}}=(\overset{\circ}{x},\overset{\circ}{y},\overset{\circ}{z})`,
and physical coordinates on the discrete surface, denoted by
:math:`\bm{{x}}=(x,y,z)` (depicted, for simplicity, as coordinates on a circle and 1D linear
element in figure :numref:`fig-sphere-coords`), to :math:`\bm{X}=(X,Y) \in \textrm{I}` on the
reference element, via the chain rule

.. math::
   \frac{\partial \overset{\circ}{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{X}}_{(3\times2)} = \frac{\partial \overset{\circ}{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{x}}_{(3\times3)} \frac{\partial\bm{x}}{\partial \bm{X}}_{(3\times2)} ,
   :label: eq-coordinate-transforms-sphere

with Jacobian determinant given by

.. math::
   :label: eq-jacobian-sphere

   \left| J \right| = \left| col_1\left(\frac{\partial \overset{\circ}{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{X}}\right) \times col_2 \left(\frac{\partial \overset{\circ}{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{X}}\right)\right| .

.. _fig-sphere-coords:

.. figure:: ../../../../img/SphereSketch.svg

   Sketch of coordinates mapping between a 1D linear element and a circle. In the
   case of a linear element the two nodes, :math:`p_0` and :math:`p_1`, marked
   by red crosses, coincide with the endpoints of the element.
   Two quadrature points, :math:`q_0` and :math:`q_1`, marked by blue dots, with
   physical coordinates denoted by :math:`\bm x(\bm X)`, are mapped to their
   corresponding radial projections on the circle, which have coordinates
   :math:`\overset{\circ}{\bm{x}}(\bm x)`.

We note that in equation :math:numref:`eq-coordinate-transforms-sphere`, the right-most
Jacobian matrix :math:`{\partial\bm{x}}/{\partial \bm{X}}_{(3\times2)}` is
provided by the library, while
:math:`{\partial \overset{\circ}{\bm{x}}}/{\partial \bm{x}}_{(3\times3)}` is
provided by the user with analytical derivatives.
In particular, for a sphere of radius 1, we have

.. math::
   \overset{\circ}{\bm x}(\bm x) = \frac{1}{\lVert \bm x \rVert} \bm x_{(3\times 1)}

and thus

.. math::
   \frac{\partial \overset{\circ}{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{x}} = \frac{1}{\lVert \bm x \rVert} \bm I_{(3\times 3)} - \frac{1}{\lVert \bm x \rVert^3} (\bm x \bm x^T)_{(3\times 3)} .


.. _example-petsc-bps:

Bakeoff problems and generalizations
----------------------------------------

The PETSc examples in this directory include a full suite of parallel
:ref:`bakeoff problems <bps>` (BPs) using a "raw" parallel decomposition
(see ``bpsraw.c``) and using PETSc's ``DMPlex`` for unstructured grid management
(see ``bps.c``). A generalization of these BPs to the surface of the cubed-sphere are
available in ``bpssphere.c``.


.. _example-petsc-bps-sphere:

Bakeoff problems on the cubed-sphere
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the :math:`L^2` projection problems, BP1-BP2, that use the mass operator, the
coordinate transformations and the corresponding Jacobian determinant,
equation :math:numref:`eq-jacobian-sphere`, are the same as in the
:ref:`example-petsc-area-sphere` example. For the Poisson's problem, BP3-BP6, on the
cubed-sphere, in addition to equation :math:numref:`eq-jacobian-sphere`, the
pseudo-inverse of :math:`\partial \overset{\circ}{\bm{x}} / \partial \bm{X}`
is used to derive the contravariant metric tensor (please see figure
:numref:`fig-sphere-coords` for a reference of the notation used). We begin by expressing the
Moore-Penrose (left) pseudo-inverse:

.. math::
   \frac{\partial \bm{X}}{\partial \overset{\circ}{\bm{x}}}_{(2\times 3)} \equiv \left(\frac{\partial \overset{\circ}{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{X}}\right)_{(2\times 3)}^{+} =  \left(\frac{\partial \overset{\circ}{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{X}}_{(2\times3)}^T \frac{\partial\overset{\circ}{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{X}}_{(3\times2)} \right)^{-1} \frac{\partial \overset{\circ}{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{X}}_{(2\times3)}^T .
   :label: eq-dxcircdX-pseudo-inv

This enables computation of gradients of an arbitrary function :math:`u(\overset{\circ}{\bm x})` in the embedding space as

.. math::
   \frac{\partial u}{\partial \overset{\circ}{\bm x}}_{(1\times 3)} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial \bm X}_{(1\times 2)} \frac{\partial \bm X}{\partial \overset{\circ}{\bm x}}_{(2\times 3)}

and thus the weak Laplacian may be expressed as

.. math::
   :label: eq-weak-laplace-sphere

   \int_{\Omega} \frac{\partial v}{\partial \overset\circ{\bm x}} \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial \overset\circ{\bm x}} \right)^T \, dS
       = \int_{\Omega} \frac{\partial v}{\partial \bm X} \underbrace{\frac{\partial \bm X}{\partial \overset\circ{\bm x}} \left( \frac{\partial \bm X}{\partial \overset\circ{\bm x}} \right)^T}_{\bm g_{(2\times 2)}}  \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial \bm X} \right)^T \, dS

where we have identified the :math:`2\times 2` contravariant metric tensor :math:`\bm g` (sometimes written :math:`\bm g^{ij}`), and where now :math:`\Omega` represents the surface of the sphere,
which is a two-dimensional closed surface embedded in the three-dimensional Euclidean space
:math:`\mathbb{R}^3`. This expression can be simplified to avoid the explicit
Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse,

.. math::
   \bm g = \left(\frac{\partial \overset{\circ}{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{X}}^T \frac{\partial\overset{\circ}{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{X}} \right)^{-1}_{(2\times 2)} \frac{\partial \overset{\circ}{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{X}}_{(2\times3)}^T
   \frac{\partial \overset{\circ}{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{X}}_{(3\times2)} \left(\frac{\partial \overset{\circ}{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{X}}^T \frac{\partial\overset{\circ}{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{X}} \right)^{-T}_{(2\times 2)}
   = \left(\frac{\partial \overset{\circ}{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{X}}^T \frac{\partial\overset{\circ}{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{X}} \right)^{-1}_{(2\times 2)}

where we have dropped the transpose due to symmetry.
This allows us to simplify :math:numref:`eq-weak-laplace-sphere` as

.. math::
   \int_{\Omega} \frac{\partial v}{\partial \overset\circ{\bm x}} \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial \overset\circ{\bm x}} \right)^T \, dS
       = \int_{\Omega} \frac{\partial v}{\partial \bm X} \underbrace{\left(\frac{\partial \overset{\circ}{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{X}}^T \frac{\partial\overset{\circ}{\bm{x}}}{\partial \bm{X}} \right)^{-1}}_{\bm g_{(2\times 2)}}  \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial \bm X} \right)^T \, dS ,

which is the form implemented in ``qfunctions/bps/bp3sphere.h``.

.. _example-petsc-multigrid:

Multigrid
----------------------------------------

This example is located in the subdirectory :file:`examples/petsc`. It
investigates :math:`p`-multigrid for the Poisson problem, equation
:math:numref:`eq-variable-coeff-poisson`, using an unstructured high-order finite
element discretization. All of the operators associated with the geometric multigrid
are implemented in libCEED.

.. math::
   -\nabla\cdot \left( \kappa \left( x \right) \nabla x \right) = g \left( x \right)
   :label: eq-variable-coeff-poisson

The Poisson operator can be specified with the decomposition given by the equation in
figure :ref:`fig-operator-decomp`, and the restriction and prolongation operators given
by interpolation basis operations, :math:`\bm{B}`, and :math:`\bm{B}^T`,
respectively, act on the different grid levels with corresponding element restrictions,
:math:`\bm{G}`. These three operations can be exploited by existing matrix-free
multigrid software and smoothers. Preconditioning based on the libCEED finite element
operator decomposition is an ongoing area of research.
