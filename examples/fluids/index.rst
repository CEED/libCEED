Compressible Navier-Stokes mini-app
========================================

This example is located in the subdirectory :file:`examples/fluids`. It solves
the time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations of compressible gas dynamics in a static
Eulerian three-dimensional frame using unstructured high-order finite/spectral
element spatial discretizations and explicit high-order time-stepping (available in
PETSc). Moreover, the Navier-Stokes example has been developed using PETSc, so that the
pointwise physics (defined at quadrature points) is separated from the parallelization
and meshing concerns.

The mathematical formulation (from :cite:`giraldoetal2010`, cfr. SE3) is given in what
follows. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations in conservative form are

.. math::
   :label: eq-ns

   \begin{aligned}
   \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{U} &= 0 \\
   \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{U}}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \left( \frac{\boldsymbol{U} \otimes \boldsymbol{U}}{\rho} + P \mathbf{I}_3 -\boldsymbol\sigma \right) + \rho g \boldsymbol{\hat k} &= 0 \\
   \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \left( \frac{(E + P)\boldsymbol{U}}{\rho} -\boldsymbol{u} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} - k \nabla T \right) &= 0 \, , \\
   \end{aligned}

where :math:`\boldsymbol{\sigma} = \mu(\nabla \boldsymbol{u} + (\nabla \boldsymbol{u})^T + \lambda (\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u})\mathbf{I}_3)`
is the Cauchy (symmetric) stress tensor, with :math:`\mu` the dynamic viscosity
coefficient, and :math:`\lambda = - 2/3` the Stokes hypothesis constant. In equations
:math:numref:`eq-ns`, :math:`\rho` represents the volume mass density, :math:`U` the
momentum density (defined as :math:`\boldsymbol{U}=\rho \boldsymbol{u}`, where
:math:`\boldsymbol{u}` is the vector velocity field), :math:`E` the total energy
density (defined as :math:`E = \rho e`, where :math:`e` is the total energy),
:math:`\mathbf{I}_3` represents the :math:`3 \times 3` identity matrix, :math:`g`
the gravitational acceleration constant, :math:`\boldsymbol{\hat{k}}` the unit vector
in the :math:`z` direction, :math:`k` the thermal conductivity constant, :math:`T`
represents the temperature, and :math:`P` the pressure, given by the following equation
of state

.. math::
   P = \left( {c_p}/{c_v} -1\right) \left( E - {\boldsymbol{U}\cdot\boldsymbol{U}}/{(2 \rho)} - \rho g z \right) \, ,
   :label: eq-state

where :math:`c_p` is the specific heat at constant pressure and :math:`c_v` is the
specific heat at constant volume (that define :math:`\gamma = c_p / c_v`, the specific
heat ratio).

The system :math:numref:`eq-ns` can be rewritten in vector form

.. math::
   :label: eq-vector-ns

   \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{q}}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{q}) -S(\boldsymbol{q}) = 0 \, ,

for the state variables 5-dimensional vector

.. math::
    \boldsymbol{q} =
           \begin{pmatrix}
               \rho \\
               \boldsymbol{U} \equiv \rho \mathbf{ u }\\
               E \equiv \rho e
           \end{pmatrix}
           \begin{array}{l}
               \leftarrow\textrm{ volume mass density}\\
               \leftarrow\textrm{ momentum density}\\
               \leftarrow\textrm{ energy density}
           \end{array}

where the flux and the source terms, respectively, are given by

.. math::

    \begin{aligned}
    \boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{q}) &=
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \boldsymbol{U}\\
        {(\boldsymbol{U} \otimes \boldsymbol{U})}/{\rho} + P \mathbf{I}_3 -  \boldsymbol{\sigma} \\
        {(E + P)\boldsymbol{U}}/{\rho} - \boldsymbol{u}  \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} - k \nabla T
    \end{pmatrix} ,\\
    S(\boldsymbol{q}) &=
    - \begin{pmatrix}
        0\\
        \rho g \boldsymbol{\hat{k}}\\
        0
    \end{pmatrix}.
    \end{aligned}

Let the discrete solution be

.. math::
   \boldsymbol{q}_N (\boldsymbol{x},t)^{(e)} = \sum_{k=1}^{P}\psi_k (\boldsymbol{x})\boldsymbol{q}_k^{(e)}

with :math:`P=p+1` the number of nodes in the element :math:`e`. We use tensor-product
bases :math:`\psi_{kji} = h_i(X_1)h_j(X_2)h_k(X_3)`.

For the time discretization, we use two types of time stepping schemes.

- Explicit time-stepping method

    The following explicit formulation is solved with the adaptive Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg
    (RKF4-5) method by default (any explicit time-stepping
    scheme available in PETSc can be chosen at runtime)

    .. math::
       \boldsymbol{q}_N^{n+1} = \boldsymbol{q}_N^n + \Delta t \sum_{i=1}^{s} b_i k_i \, ,

    where

    .. math::

       \begin{aligned}
          k_1 &= f(t^n, \boldsymbol{q}_N^n)\\
          k_2 &= f(t^n + c_2 \Delta t, \boldsymbol{q}_N^n + \Delta t (a_{21} k_1))\\
          k_3 &= f(t^n + c_3 \Delta t, \boldsymbol{q}_N^n + \Delta t (a_{31} k_1 + a_{32} k_2))\\
          \vdots&\\
          k_i &= f\left(t^n + c_i \Delta t, \boldsymbol{q}_N^n + \Delta t \sum_{j=1}^s a_{ij} k_j \right)\\
       \end{aligned}

    and with

    .. math::
       f(t^n, \boldsymbol{q}_N^n) = - [\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{q}_N)]^n + [S(\boldsymbol{q}_N)]^n \, .

- Implicit time-stepping method

    This time stepping method which can be selected using the option ``-implicit`` is
    solved with Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) method by default (similarly,
    any implicit time-stepping scheme available in PETSc can be chosen at runtime).
    The implicit formulation solves nonlinear systems for :math:`\bm q_N`:

    .. math::
       :label: eq-ts-implicit-ns

       \bm f(\bm q_N) \equiv \bm g(t^{n+1}, \boldsymbol{q}_N, \boldsymbol{\dot{q}}_N) = 0 \, ,

    where the time derivative :math:`\bm{\dot q}_N` is defined by

    .. math::
      \boldsymbol{\dot{q}}_N(\bm q_N) = \alpha \bm q_N + \bm z_N

    in terms of :math:`\bm z_N` from prior state and :math:`\alpha > 0`,
    both of which depend on the specific time integration scheme (backward difference
    formulas, generalized alpha, implicit Runge-Kutta, etc.).
    Each nonlinear system :math:numref:`eq-ts-implicit-ns` will correspond to a
    weak form, as explained below.
    In determining how difficult a given problem is to solve, we consider the
    Jacobian of :math:numref:`eq-ts-implicit-ns`,

    .. math::
       \frac{\partial \bm f}{\partial \bm q_N}
       = \frac{\partial \bm g}{\partial \bm q_N}
       + \alpha \frac{\partial \bm g}{\partial \bm{\dot q}_N}.

    The scalar "shift" :math:`\alpha` scales inversely with the time step
    :math:`\Delta t`, so small time steps result in the Jacobian being dominated
    by the second term, which is a sort of "mass matrix", and typically
    well-conditioned independent of grid resolution with a simple preconditioner
    (such as Jacobi).
    In contrast, the first term dominates for large time steps, with a condition
    number that grows with the diameter of the domain and polynomial degree of
    the approximation space.  Both terms are significant for time-accurate
    simulation and the setup costs of strong preconditioners must be balanced
    with the convergence rate of Krylov methods using weak preconditioners.

To obtain a finite element discretization, we first multiply the strong form
:math:numref:`eq-vector-ns` by a test function :math:`\boldsymbol v \in H^1(\Omega)`
and integrate,

.. math::
   \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol v \cdot \left(\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{q}_N}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{q}_N) - \mathbf{S}(\boldsymbol{q}_N) \right) \,dV = 0 \, , \; \forall \boldsymbol v \in \mathcal{V}_p\,,

with :math:`\mathcal{V}_p = \{ \boldsymbol v(\mathbf x) \in H^{1}(\Omega_e) \,|\, \boldsymbol v(\mathbf x_e(\mathbf X)) \in P_p(\boldsymbol{I}), e=1,\ldots,N_e \}`
a mapped space of polynomials containing at least polynomials of degree :math:`p`
(with or without the higher mixed terms that appear in tensor product spaces).

Integrating by parts on the divergence term, we arrive at the weak form,

.. math::
   :label: eq-weak-vector-ns

   \begin{aligned}
   \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol v \cdot \left( \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{q}_N}{\partial t} - \mathbf{S}(\boldsymbol{q}_N) \right)  \,dV
   - \int_{\Omega} \nabla \boldsymbol v \!:\! \boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{q}_N)\,dV & \\
   + \int_{\partial \Omega} \boldsymbol v \cdot \boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol q_N) \cdot \widehat{\mathbf{n}} \,dS
     &= 0 \, , \; \forall \boldsymbol v \in \mathcal{V}_p \,,
   \end{aligned}

where :math:`\boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol q_N) \cdot \widehat{\mathbf{n}}` is typically
replaced with a boundary condition.

.. note::
  The notation :math:`\nabla \boldsymbol v \!:\! \boldsymbol F` represents contraction over both fields and spatial dimensions while a single dot represents contraction in just one, which should be clear from context, e.g., :math:`\boldsymbol v \cdot \boldsymbol S` contracts over fields while :math:`\boldsymbol F \cdot \widehat{\mathbf n}` contracts over spatial dimensions.

We solve :math:numref:`eq-weak-vector-ns` using a Galerkin discretization (default)
or a stabilized method, as is necessary for most real-world flows.

Galerkin methods produce oscillations for transport-dominated problems (any time
the cell PÃ©clet number is larger than 1), and those tend to blow up for nonlinear
problems such as the Euler equations and (low-viscosity/poorly resolved) Navier-Stokes,
in which case stabilization is necessary. Our formulation follows :cite:`hughesetal2010`,
which offers a comprehensive review of stabilization and shock-capturing methods
for continuous finite element discretization of compressible flows.

- **SUPG** (streamline-upwind/Petrov-Galerkin)

    In this method, the weighted residual of the strong form
    :math:numref:`eq-vector-ns` is added to the Galerkin formulation
    :math:numref:`eq-weak-vector-ns`. The weak form for this method is given as

    .. math::
       :label: eq-weak-vector-ns-supg

       \begin{aligned}
       \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol v \cdot \left( \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{q}_N}{\partial t} - \mathbf{S}(\boldsymbol{q}_N) \right)  \,dV
       - \int_{\Omega} \nabla \boldsymbol v \!:\! \boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{q}_N)\,dV & \\
       + \int_{\partial \Omega} \boldsymbol v \cdot \boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{q}_N) \cdot \widehat{\mathbf{n}} \,dS & \\
       + \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{P}(\boldsymbol v)^T \, \left( \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{q}_N}{\partial t} \, + \,
       \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{F} \, (\boldsymbol{q}_N) - \mathbf{S}(\boldsymbol{q}_N) \right) \,dV &= 0
       \, , \; \forall \boldsymbol v \in \mathcal{V}_p
       \end{aligned}

    This stabilization technique can be selected using the option ``-stab supg``.


- **SU** (streamline-upwind)

    This method is a simplified version of *SUPG* :math:numref:`eq-weak-vector-ns-supg`
    which is developed for debugging/comparison purposes. The weak form for this method
    is

    .. math::
       :label: eq-weak-vector-ns-su

       \begin{aligned}
       \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol v \cdot \left( \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{q}_N}{\partial t} - \mathbf{S}(\boldsymbol{q}_N) \right)  \,dV
       - \int_{\Omega} \nabla \boldsymbol v \!:\! \boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{q}_N)\,dV & \\
       + \int_{\partial \Omega} \boldsymbol v \cdot \boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{q}_N) \cdot \widehat{\mathbf{n}} \,dS & \\
       + \int_{\Omega} \boldsymbol{P}(\boldsymbol v)^T \, \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{F} \, (\boldsymbol{q}_N) \,dV
       & = 0 \, , \; \forall \boldsymbol v \in \mathcal{V}_p
       \end{aligned}

    This stabilization technique can be selected using the option ``-stab su``.


In both :math:numref:`eq-weak-vector-ns-su` and :math:numref:`eq-weak-vector-ns-supg`,
:math:`\boldsymbol{P} \,` is called the *perturbation to the test-function space*,
since it modifies the original Galerkin method into *SUPG* or *SU* schemes. It is defined
as

.. math::
   \boldsymbol{P}(\boldsymbol v) \equiv \left(\boldsymbol{\tau} \cdot \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{F} \, (\boldsymbol{q}_N)}{\partial
   \boldsymbol{q}_N} \right)^T \, \nabla \boldsymbol v\,,

where parameter :math:`\boldsymbol{\tau} \in \mathbb R^{3\times 3}` is an intrinsic time/space scale matrix.

Currently, this demo provides two types of problems/physical models that can be selected
at run time via the option ``-problem``. One is the problem of transport of energy in a
uniform vector velocity field, called the :ref:`problem-advection` problem, and is the
so called :ref:`problem-density-current` problem.


.. _problem-advection:

Advection
----------------------------------------

A simplified version of system :math:numref:`eq-ns`, only accounting for the transport
of total energy, is given by

.. math::
   \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\boldsymbol{u} E ) = 0 \, ,
   :label: eq-advection

with :math:`\boldsymbol{u}` the vector velocity field. In this particular test case, a
blob of total energy (defined by a characteristic radius :math:`r_c`) is transported by
a uniform circular velocity field. We have solved :math:numref:`eq-advection` with
no-slip and non-penetration boundary conditions for :math:`\boldsymbol{u}`, and no-flux
for :math:`E`. This problem can be run with::

   ./navierstokes -problem advection


.. _problem-density-current:

Density Current
----------------------------------------

For this test problem (from :cite:`straka1993numerical`), we solve the full
Navier-Stokes equations :math:numref:`eq-ns`, for which a cold air bubble
(of radius :math:`r_c`) drops by convection in a neutrally stratified atmosphere.
Its initial condition is defined in terms of the Exner pressure,
:math:`\pi(\boldsymbol{x},t)`, and potential temperature,
:math:`\theta(\boldsymbol{x},t)`, that relate to the state variables via

.. math::
   \begin{aligned}
   \rho &= \frac{P_0}{( c_p - c_v)\theta(\boldsymbol{x},t)} \pi(\boldsymbol{x},t)^{\frac{c_v}{ c_p - c_v}} \, , \\
   e &= c_v \theta(\boldsymbol{x},t) \pi(\boldsymbol{x},t) + \boldsymbol{u}\cdot \boldsymbol{u} /2 + g z \, ,
   \end{aligned}

where :math:`P_0` is the atmospheric pressure. For this problem, we have used no-slip
and non-penetration boundary conditions for :math:`\boldsymbol{u}`, and no-flux
for mass and energy densities. This problem can be run with::

   ./navierstokes -problem density_current
