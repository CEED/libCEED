## libCEED: Navier-Stokes Example

This page provides a description of the Navier-Stokes example for the libCEED library, based on PETSc.

The Navier-Stokes problem solves the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in three dimensions using an
explicit time integration. The state variables are mass density, momentum density, and energy density.

The main Navier-Stokes solver for libCEED is defined in [`navierstokes.c`](navierstokes.c)
with different problem definitions according to the application of interest.

Build by using

`make`

and run with

`./navierstokes`

### Time Discretization

For all different problems, the time integration is performed with an explicit
or implicit formulation.

### Space Discretization

The geometric factors and coordinate transformations required for the integration of the weak form
for the interior domain and for the boundaries are described in the files [`common.h`](common.h)
and [`setup-boundary.h`](setup-boundary.h), respectively.
