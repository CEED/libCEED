# libCEED: Navier-Stokes Example

This page provides a description of the Navier-Stokes example for the libCEED library, based on PETSc.

The Navier-Stokes problem solves the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in three dimensions using an
explicit time integration. The state variables are mass density, momentum density, and energy density.

The main Navier-Stokes solver for libCEED is defined in [`navierstokes.c`](navierstokes.c)
with different problem definitions according to the application of interest.

`make`

## Advection

This problem solves the convection (advection) equation for the total (scalar) energy density,
transported by the (vector) velocity field.

This is 3D advection given in two formulations based upon the weak form.

State Variables:

   *q = ( rho, U<sub>1</sub>, U<sub>2</sub>, U<sub>3</sub>, E )*
    
   *rho* - Mass Density
    
   *U<sub>i</sub>*  - Momentum Density    ,   *U<sub>i</sub> = rho ui*
    
   *E*   - Total Energy Density,   *E  = rho Cv T + rho (u u) / 2 + rho g z*
    
Advection Equation:

   *dE/dt + div( E _u_ ) = 0*

Momentum Density:
    Rotational field in x,y with no momentum in z

    Maximum of 1. x0 decreasing linearly to 0. as radial distance increases
    to 1/8, then 0. everywhere else

## Density Current

This problem solves the full compressible Navier-Stokes equations, using
operator composition and design of coupled solvers in the context of atmospheric
modeling. This problem uses the formulation given in Semi-Implicit Formulations
of the Navier-Stokes Equations: Application to Nonhydrostatic Atmospheric Modeling,
Giraldo, Restelli, and Lauter (2010).

The 3D compressible Navier-Stokes equations are formulated in conservation form with state
variables of density, momentum density, and total energy density.

Navier-Stokes Equations:

   *drho/dt + div( U )                               = 0*

   *dU/dt   + div( rho (u x u) + P I<sub>3</sub> ) + rho g khat = div( F<sub>u</sub> )*

   *dE/dt   + div( (E + P) u )                       = div( F<sub>e</sub> )*

## Time Discretization

For all different problems, the time integration is performed with an explicit formulation, therefore
it can be subject to numerical instability, if run for large times or with large time steps.

## Space Discretization

The geometric factors and coordinate transformations required for the integration of the weak form
are described in the file [`common.h`](common.h)
