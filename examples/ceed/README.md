## libCEED: Basic Examples

Two examples are provided that rely only upon libCEED without any external
libraries.

### Example 1

This example uses the mass matrix to compute the length, area, or volume of a
region, depending upon runtime parameters.

### Example 2

This example uses the diffusion matrix to compute the surface area of a region,
depending upon runtime parameters.
