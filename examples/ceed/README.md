## libCEED: Basic Examples

Two examples are provided that rely only upon libCEED without any external libraries.

### Example 1: ex1-volume

This example uses the mass matrix to compute the length, area, or volume of a region, depending upon runtime parameters.

### Example 2: ex2-surface

This example uses the diffusion matrix to compute the surface area of a region, in 1D, 2D or 3D, depending upon runtime parameters.
