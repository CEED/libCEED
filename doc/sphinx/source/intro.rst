Introduction
========================================

Historically, conventional high-order finite element methods were rarely used for
industrial problems because the Jacobian rapidly loses sparsity as the order is
increased, leading to unaffordable solve times and memory requirements
:cite:`brown2010`. This effect typically limited the order of accuracy to at most
quadratic, especially because quadratic finite element formulations are computationally advantageous in terms of
floating point operations (FLOPS) per degree of freedom (DOF)---see
:numref:`fig-assembledVsmatrix-free`---, despite the fast convergence and favorable
stability properties offered by higher order discretizations. Nowadays, high-order
numerical methods, such as the spectral element method (SEM)---a special case of
nodal p-Finite Element Method (FEM) which can reuse the interpolation nodes for
quadrature---are employed, especially with (nearly) affine elements, because
linear constant coefficient problems can be very efficiently solved using the
fast diagonalization method combined with a multilevel coarse solve. In
:numref:`fig-assembledVsmatrix-free` we analyze and compare the theoretical costs,
of different configurations: assembling the sparse matrix representing the action
of the operator (labeled as *assembled*), non assembling the matrix and storing
only the metric terms needed as an operator setup-phase (labeled as *tensor-qstore*)
and non assembling  the matrix and computing the metric terms on the fly and storing
a compact representation of the linearization at quadrature points (labeled as
*tensor*). In the right panel, we show the cost in terms of FLOPS/DOF. This metric for
computational efficiency made sense historically, when the performance was mostly
limited by processors' clockspeed. A more relevant performance plot for current
state-of-the-art high-performance machines (for which the bottleneck of performance is
mostly in the memory bandwith) is shown in the left panel of
:numref:`fig-assembledVsmatrix-free`, where the memory bandwith is measured in terms of
bytes/DOF. We can see that high-order methods, implemented properly with only partial
assembly, require optimal amount of memory transfers (with respect to the
polynomial order) and near-optimal FLOPs for operator evaluation. Thus, high-order
methods in matrix-free representation not only possess favorable properties, such as
higher accuracy and faster convergence to solution, but also manifest an efficiency gain
compared to their corresponding assembled representations.

   Comparison of memory transfer and floating point operations per
   degree of freedom for different representations of a linear operator for a PDE in
   3D with :math:`b` components and variable coefficients arising due to Newton
   linearization of a material nonlinearity. The representation labeled as *tensor*
   computes metric terms on the fly and stores a compact representation of the
   linearization at quadrature points. The representation labeled as *tensor-qstore*
   pulls the metric terms into the stored representation. The *assembled* representation
   uses a (block) CSR format.

Furthermore, software packages that provide high-performance implementations have often
been special-purpose and intrusive. libCEED is a new library that offers a purely
algebraic interface for matrix-free operator representation and supports run-time
selection of implementations tuned for a variety of computational device types,
including CPUs and GPUs. libCEED's purely algebraic interface can unobtrusively be
integrated in new and legacy software to provide performance portable interfaces.
While libCEED's focus is on high-order finite elements, the approach is algebraic
and thus applicable to other discretizations in factored form. libCEED's role, as
a lightweight portable library that allows a wide variety of applications to share
highly optimized discretization kernels, is illustrated in
:numref:`fig-libCEED-backends`, where a non-exhaustive list of specialized
implementations (backends) is provided. libCEED provides a low-level Application
Programming Interface (API) for user codes so that applications with their own
discretization infrastructure (e.g., those in `PETSc <https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/>`_,
`MFEM <https://mfem.org/>`_ and `Nek5000 <https://nek5000.mcs.anl.gov/>`_) can evaluate
and use the core operations provided by libCEED. GPU implementations are available via
pure `CUDA <https://developer.nvidia.com/about-cuda>`_ as well as the
`OCCA <http://github.com/libocca/occa>`_ and `MAGMA <https://bitbucket.org/icl/magma>`_
libraries. CPU implementations are available via pure C and AVX intrinsics as well as
the `LIBXSMM <http://github.com/hfp/libxsmm>`_ library. libCEED provides a unified
interface, so that users only need to write a single source code and can select the
desired specialized implementation at run time. Moreover, each process or thread can
instantiate an arbitrary number of backends.

   The role of libCEED as a lightweight, portable library which provides a low-level
   API for efficient, specialized implementations. libCEED allows different applications
   to share highly optimized discretization kernels.
