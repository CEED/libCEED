Julia, Python, and Rust Interfaces
========================================

libCEED provides high-level interfaces using the Julia, Python, and Rust
programming languages.

More information about the Julia interface can be found at the `LibCEED.jl
documentation <http://ceed.exascaleproject.org/libCEED-julia-docs/dev/>`_.

Usage of the Python interface is illustrated through a sequence of `Jupyter
Notebook tutorials
<https://github.com/CEED/libCEED/tree/main/examples/tutorials>`_. More
information on the Python interface is available in the `SciPy paper
<https://doi.org/10.25080/Majora-342d178e-00c>`_.

More information about the Rust interface can be found at the `Rust interface
documentation <http://ceed.exascaleproject.org/libCEED-rust-docs>`_.
