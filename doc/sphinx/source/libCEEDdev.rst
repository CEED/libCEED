Developer Notes
========================================


Shape
----------------------------------------

Backends often manipulate tensors of dimension greater than 2.  It is
awkward to pass fully-specified multi-dimensional arrays using C99 and
certain operations will flatten/reshape the tensors for computational
convenience.  We frequently use comments to document shapes using a
lexicographic ordering.  For example, the comment

.. code-block:: c

   // u has shape [dim, ncomp, Q, nelem]

means that it can be traversed as

.. code-block:: c

   for (d=0; d<dim; d++)
     for (c=0; c<ncomp; c++)
       for (q=0; q<Q; q++)
         for (e=0; e<nelem; e++)
           u[((d*ncomp + c)*Q + q)*nelem + e] = ...

This ordering is sometimes referred to as row-major or C-style.  Note
that flattening such as

.. code-block:: c

   // u has shape [dim, ncomp, Q*nelem]

and

.. code-block:: c

   // u has shape [dim*ncomp, Q, nelem]

are purely implicit -- one just indexes the same array using the
appropriate convention.


Internal Layouts
----------------------------------------

Ceed backends are free to use any **E-vector** and **Q-vector** data layout, to include never fully forming these vectors, so long as the backend passes the ``t5**`` series tests and all examples.
There are several common layouts for **L-vectors**, **E-vectors**, and **Q-vectors**, detailed below:

* **L-vector** layouts

  * **L-vectors** described by a :ref:`CeedElemRestriction` have a layout described by the ``offsets`` array and ``compstride`` parameter.
    Data for node ``i``, component ``j``, element ``k`` can be found in the **L-vector** at index ``offsets[i + k*elemsize] + j*compstride``.

  * **L-vectors** described by a strided :ref:`CeedElemRestriction` have a layout described by the ``strides`` array.
    Data for node ``i``, component ``j``, element ``k`` can be found in the **L-vector** at index ``i*strides[0] + j*strides[1] + k*strides[2]``.

* **E-vector** layouts

  * If possible, backends should use :c:func:`CeedElemRestrictionSetELayout()` to use the ``t2**`` tests.
    If the backend uses a strided **E-vector** layout, then the data for node ``i``, component ``j``, element ``k`` in the **E-vector** is given by ``i*layout[0] + j*layout[1] + k*layout[2]``.

  * Backends may choose to use a non-strided **E-vector** layout; however, the ``t2**`` tests will not function correctly in this case and the tests will need to be whitelisted for the backend to pass the test suite.

* **Q-vector** layouts

  * When the size of a :ref:`CeedQFunction` field is greater than ``1``, data for quadrature point ``i`` component ``j`` can be found in the **Q-vector** at index ``i + Q*j``.
    Backends are free to provide the quadrature points in any order.

  * When the :ref:`CeedQFunction` field has ``emode`` ``CEED_EVAL_GRAD``, data for quadrature point ``i``, component ``j``, derivative ``k`` can be found in the **Q-vector** at index ``i + Q*j + Q*size*k``.

  * Note that backend developers must take special care to ensure that the data in the **Q-vectors** for a field with ``emode`` ``CEED_EVAL_NONE`` is properly ordered when the backend uses different layouts for **E-vectors** and **Q-vectors**.


Backend Inheritance
----------------------------------------

There are three mechanisms by which a Ceed backend can inherit implementation from another Ceed backend.
These options are set in the backend initialization routine.

#. Delegation - Developers may use :c:func:`CeedSetDelegate()` to set a backend that will provide the implementation of any unimplemented Ceed objects.

#. Object delegation  - Developers may use :c:func:`CeedSetObjectDelegate()` to set a backend that will provide the implementation of a specific unimplemented Ceed object.
   Object delegation has higher precedence than delegation.

#. Operator fallback - Developers may use :c:func:`CeedSetOperatorFallbackResource()` to set a :ref:`Ceed` resource that will provide the implementation of unimplemented :ref:`CeedOperator` methods.
   A fallback :ref:`Ceed` with this resource will only be instantiated if a method is called that is not implemented by the parent :ref:`Ceed`.
   In order to use the fallback mechanism, the parent :ref:`Ceed` and fallback resource must use compatible **E-vector** and **Q-vector** layouts.


Clang-tidy
----------------------------------------

Please check your code for common issues by running

``make tidy``

which uses the ``clang-tidy`` utility included in recent releases of Clang.  This
tool is much slower than actual compilation (``make -j8`` parallelism helps).  To
run on a single file, use

``make interface/ceed.c.tidy``

for example.  All issues reported by ``make tidy`` should be fixed.
