# libceed: efficient, extensible discretization

This crate provides an interface to [libCEED](https://libceed.org), which is a performance-portable library for extensible element-based discretization for partial differential equations and related computational problems.
The formulation is algebraic and intended to be lightweight and easy to incorporate in higher level abstractions.
See the [libCEED user manual](https://libceed.org) for details on [interface concepts](https://libceed.org/en/latest/libCEEDapi/) and extensive examples.

## Usage

To call libCEED from a Rust package, the following `Cargo.toml` can be used.
```toml
[dependencies]
libceed = "0.12.0"
```

For a development version of the libCEED Rust bindings, use the following `Cargo.toml`.
```toml
[dependencies]
libceed = { git = "https://github.com/CEED/libCEED", branch = "main" }
```

```rust
extern crate libceed;

fn main() -> libceed::Result<()> {
    let ceed = libceed::Ceed::init("/cpu/self/ref");
    let xc = ceed.vector_from_slice(&[0., 0.5, 1.0])?;
    let xs = xc.view()?;
    assert_eq!(xs[..], [0., 0.5, 1.0]);
    Ok(())
}
```

This crate provides modules for each object, but they are usually created from the `Ceed` object as with the vector above.
The resource string passed to `Ceed::init` is used to identify the "backend", which includes algorithmic strategies and hardware such as NVIDIA and AMD GPUs.
See the [libCEED documentation](https://libceed.org/en/latest/gettingstarted/#backends) for more information on available backends.

## Examples

Examples of libCEED can be found in the [libCEED repository](https://github.com/CEED/libCEED) under the `examples/rust` directory.

## Documentation

This crate uses `katexit` to render equations in the documentation.
To build the [documentation](https://docs.rs/libceed) locally with `katexit` enabled, use

```bash
cargo doc --features=katexit
```
