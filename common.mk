# make-4.3 allows string literals like "#include" in variables, but older versions need "\#include". Specifically, the following code:
#
# X := $(shell echo "#foo")
#
# works with make-4.3, but fails with previous versions:
#
# Makefile:1: *** unterminated call to function 'shell': missing ')'.  Stop.
#
# Older versions work if you spell it "\#foo", but 4.3 will include the backslash. We define $(HASH), which works consistently across versions.
