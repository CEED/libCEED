# A bug in Julia 1.6.0's Pkg causes Preferences to be dropped during `Pkg.test()`, so we work around
# it by explicitly creating a `test/Project.toml` which will correctly communicate any preferences
# through to the child Julia process.  X-ref: https://github.com/JuliaLang/Pkg.jl/issues/2500
# See also test/Project.toml in FFTW.jl.
